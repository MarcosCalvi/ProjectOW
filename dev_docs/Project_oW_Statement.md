		ProjectoW Statement	
		
		
    I have esentially outlined in my head the structure and I am intending to do basically a survival game, you will have to keep you alive as the days are passing in an island where you have shipwrecked. The time I thought of is the sixties of the XX century, I have in my mind a couple of twists in the history to provide the character with some tools, machete, axe from a lost japanese camp which left behind from WWII, maybe I include the famous japanese who did not surrender until the seventies, I think is a funny story to include. Maybe some shot down Zero could be usable just to give the character a couple of tools. I am introducing some dinosaurs too, as well as animals to hunt, fish you can fish, vegetables... As I am writing I am seeing a lot of work there but I am confident, haha... The dinosaurs thing is mostly because my nephews like them, so... Maybe some nuclear test made them appear in that island, hehe. 


    Now I am, aside from creating the character and animating it, trying to get the logic of the character to have the need to feet himself, the life system, dead, and all that. I think it is pretty doable, the animals and dinosaurs should have the need to eat and behave accordingly. Maybe it will be a little tricky but I think it will be interesting too. Then I am going to go for the daycycle and the weather, that will be pretty tricky too, this I don't really know how will be done, I am going to use the time of day the api has included but I still don't know what will the best way to treat the sky, clouds, stars and all that.

    Well, I think that is pretty big by itself, to that you have to add the environment creation and optimization and all that and, the two other big things I am planning, the abilities and building system and I am going to try to do an online cooperative mode. The last is other part that I am interested in doing because of the users system online, authentication, databases and that, I think is going to be a good practice for creating websites. For this I am thinking of making a Digital Ocean account to host the online part. The lowest price account  is only 5$ per month so it is not a big cost to start working with the server.


    Aside from all the technical things I am going to try to get a little reward for the work, if I can. I plan, if the project gets to a presentable state, release and alpha that people can already play and do a Kickstarter campaign or some like that, basically to initially fund the servers and see what happens. With the crowdfunding I also would like to purchase a license for blend4web, so if I want to get it out of the open source I can.


    So, if the project goes that far, you can try even to sell the subscriptions or whatever. I think the tools are there to do it, although anything can happens that leads you to a dead end, being realistic.


    So you are invited to collaborate the way you think you can. Any help is welcome with the things you are more comfortable in and if you want to work until it is in a playable state you and even more people could enter with me in the crowdfunding and all that. I think it is a little early to see if it can really happens but well, it is to have an overlook of the project.


    Well, you can contact me in the email below if you want to make some work and if not I hope you can see the evolution of it in the GitHub repository.
